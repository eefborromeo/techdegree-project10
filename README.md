This is my submission for Project 10: Use a Public API to Create a Front End for an Employee Directory.

In this project, I used the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype an employee directory. I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
